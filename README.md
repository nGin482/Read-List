# This Project
A reading list web application that manages a list of fanfics that are considered worth reading. 

These stories are collected from across a number of different fandoms from Fanfiction.Net and Archive of our Own. 
The details of these stories are collected by a python project that are then sent to this project by means of an API call to the Read List's back-end server. There is a JSON file created each time this project receives the stories collected.

This repository features a back end server that collects a number of fanfics from different archives across AO3 and FFN; as well as a front end that allows the user to view the stories.

## Known Issues
1. Delete handler from the main page not performing as expected
2. Updating story data across all files not performing as expected on backend - review if this is necessary
    - will be updating story in read list DB instead

## To Do
1. List of stories to ignore
2. ErrorNotification service - discord.js
3. Re-organise the components directory
4. Mobile Design
5. Update styles
6. Update Documentation
7. Deploy



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
